# RFIDs-and-IoT-in-Java

The Java code revolves around a system designed to manage shipping containers, allowing for the entry and tracking of container contents through either manual input or RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) technology. Users can interact with the system via a menu-driven interface to manually enter container contents or use RFID for automated data entry. The system supports adding new containers, listing their contents along with quantities, and provides an option to print detailed information about all containers managed by the system. This setup showcases the integration of manual and automated data entry methods in managing logistical operations, particularly in tracking and organizing the contents of shipping containers in a warehouse or shipping environment.
